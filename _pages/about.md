I am an Early Career Teaching and Research Fellow in Economics at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford. My research focuses on topics in Health Economics. My speciality is in applying econometric methods to health-related research questions. I teach Microeconomics related subjects to undergraduate students at the University of Oxford.

I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics from the University of Southampton in 2016. Subsequently, I studied for an MSc. and a Ph.D. in Economics, also at the University of Southampton, which were both funded through an ESRC DTC 1+3 Research Studentship. During my Ph.D. studies I was on a secondment at the Department for Education (UK), where I spent some time researching school exclusions and factors associated with disadvantaged pupil performance.
