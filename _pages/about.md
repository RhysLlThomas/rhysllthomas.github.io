I am a Health Economics Researcher in the Health Economics Research Centre (HERC), Department of Population Health at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on applying econometric techniques to questions in Health Economics.

I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Southampton in 2016. Subsequently, I studied for an MSc. and a Ph.D. in Economics, also at the University of Southampton, which were both funded through an ESRC DTC 1+3 Research Studentship. Prior to joining HERC, I was an Early Career Teaching and Research Fellow in Economics at St Edmund Hall, University of Oxford, where I am now a Fellow by Special Election. At St Edmund Hall I primarily taught undergraduates Microeconomics-related subjects.
