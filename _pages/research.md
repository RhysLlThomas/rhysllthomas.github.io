### **The spillover effects of diabetes diagnosis on partners' behaviour (Job Market Paper)**
### with [Emmanouil Mentzakis](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/socsci/about/staff/em3r11.page)
**Abstract**
Diabetes is a unique condition, in that the first line of treatment of the condition is the same as the suggested prevention of the disease, both being positive lifestyle behaviours. It is theoretically possible that by jointly partaking in diabetes treatment, partners of diabetics would substantially benefit from their partners' diabetes diagnosis. This theoretical possibility is supported by previous literature on spousal correlation. Using blood data from the Health Survey for England, and a regression kink design, we causally estimate the effect of a diabetes diagnosis on health-related behaviours of the diabetic as well as their partners. We find that a diagnosis of diabetes results in a significant increase in the probability of exercising, and decreases the probability of consuming fruit, as well as a decrease in the probability of currently being a smoker. Partner's of diabetics also tend to have an increased probability of exercising, and a decrease in fruit consumption although there is limited evidence of other behavioural changes. From a public health perspective, it is reassuring to see that physical activity increases from a diagnosis, and we show that there are positive spillovers from this effect. It is worrying, however, to note that although fruit consumption decreases, there is no compensatory change in vegetable consumption and this effect also extends to partners of diabetics. Our results are especially important for the evaluation of diabetes related policies, but also show more generally, that health-related polices which target individuals' behaviours have substantial spillover effects, particularly within households, which require consideration in the evaluation of those policies.

### **Redistributive Effects of Medicaid**
### with [Emmanouil Mentzakis](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/socsci/about/staff/em3r11.page)
**Abstract**
Using data from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE) we analyse the redistributive impacts of a publicly financed health insurance expansion. We use a residual inclusion methodology combined with quantile, and ordered logit regressions to estimate the heterogeneity in the effects of health insurance across the income distribution. We find that there are indeed redistributive impacts, even in the small income window we have access to, which would otherwise be concealed in a linear regression. Those at the lower end of the income distribution tend to have a substantial increase in their disposable income as a result of health insurance coverage, while those at the upper end see no change in income.
